# Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

## What is IaC?
- Infrastructure as Code is a method of managing and provisioning computing resources through machine-readable configuration files, rather than through physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools.
- In simpler terms, it means you write code to manage your infrastructure.
- With IaC, you create a blueprint (in the form of code) that builds the infrastructure for you, every time, consistently.
### Example
- Think of it like writing a script for creating virtual machines (VMs) on AWS or Google Cloud.
- Instead of clicking through the cloud provider’s interface, you can run a script that does it for you.
- It allows:
	- Automate the creation, modification, and destruction of infrastructure.
	- Treat infrastructure like software. If something changes, just update the code and rerun it.

## Advantages of IaC over Manual Infrastructure Management
- `Consistency and Repeatability`: When you write the code, you are making sure that every time you deploy your infrastructure, it will look exactly the same. This reduces human errors.
- `Version Control`: Just like software code, your infrastructure code can be stored in Git or other version control systems. You can track changes, revert to older configurations, and review the history of changes.
- `Speed and Automation`: Automating infrastructure setup through code is faster.
- `Collaboration`: Multiple team members can work together on the same infrastructure code, making it easier to share responsibility.
- `Testing`: IaC allows you to test your infrastructure changes before deploying them.
- `Reusability`: You can also reuse parts of your code, such as modules for setting up servers, databases, or networks, across multiple projects.

# Terraform

## What is Terraform?
- Terraform is one of the most popular tools for implementing IaC.
- It allows users to define both cloud and on-premises resources in a simple, human-readable language called HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language). 
- Terraform is designed to work with many different cloud providers, including AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud.
- Terraform is an open-source tool that allows you to define, preview, and deploy cloud infrastructure by writing code. 

## Common use cases where Terraform shines
- `Cloud Infrastructure Provisioning`: Use Terraform to provision (create) infrastructure like virtual machines, storage, and networking in cloud environments such as AWS or Google Cloud.
    - Example: Write a Terraform script that creates a set of web servers, a load balancer, and a database automatically when deployed.
- `Multi-Cloud Environments`: If you want to use more than one cloud provider, Terraform can manage both within a single configuration file.
    - Example: Create a multi-cloud environment where your web application is hosted on AWS, but your data analysis tools run on Google Cloud.
- `Infrastructure Scaling`: Terraform can automate scaling your infrastructure up and down based on demand.
    - Example: As the traffic to your website increases, Terraform can automatically create more web servers, and when traffic decreases, it can reduce them to save cost.
- `Disaster Recovery`: In the event of a disaster, where your infrastructure is compromised or lost, you can quickly recreate it by running your Terraform script.
    - Example:  If your cloud region goes down, Terraform can be used to set up the same infrastructure in a different region in a few minutes.
- `CI/CD Pipelines`: Terraform is also commonly used in Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines to automatically deploy infrastructure as part of software updates.
    - Example: When a new version of your web app is pushed to production, Terraform can provision new servers and update the load balancer, all as part of an automated pipeline.

## Terraform Architecture

### Providers
- These are plugins that Terraform uses to interact with different platforms and services (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, Azure).
- Example: You can use the AWS provider to create EC2 instances or the Azure provider to create virtual machines.

### Resources
- Resources are the building blocks of your infrastructure. You define these in your Terraform configuration files.
- Example: A virtual machine, a database, or a storage bucket are all resources that you can create and manage with Terraform.

### Modules
- A module is a collection of related resources that are managed together. It allows you to reuse code and share it across different projects.
- Example: You could have a module that sets up a complete web application environment (servers, databases, and networking).

### State
- Terraform keeps track of the infrastructure it manages using a state file. This state file records what resources exist and their current configuration.
- Example: If you’ve already deployed 5 servers and then decide to add 2 more, Terraform checks the state file to see what’s already been deployed, then adds only the 2 new servers.

## Comparisons with other IaC tools
- Terraform is often compared with Ansible, CloudFormation, and Puppet.

### Terraform vs Ansible
- Approach
    - Terraform uses a declarative approach, meaning you declare what you want (e.g., “I want 3 servers”), and Terraform figures out how to make that happen.
    - Ansible uses an imperative approach, meaning you tell it exactly what steps to take (e.g., “Create a server, then install a web server, then configure the firewall”).
- Configuration Language
    - Terraform uses HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language), which is simple, human-readable, and specifically designed for defining infrastructure.
    - Ansible uses YAML to define playbooks, which can make it easier to use for configuration management but harder to manage infrastructure at scale.
- Provisioning vs Configuration Management
    - Terraform is focused primarily on provisioning infrastructure (creating VMs, networking, storage, etc.), making it ideal for cloud deployments.
    - Ansible is designed for configuration management, which means it’s better suited for installing software, managing system states, and performing administrative tasks on servers.
- Summary
    - If you need to create virtual machines in AWS, configure them with web servers, and ensure they are running the correct software, you might use Terraform to create the VMs and Ansible to configure the software and settings on those VMs.

### Terraform vs AWS CloudFormation
- Multi-Cloud Support
    - Terraform is multi-cloud. It can be used to provision infrastructure across multiple cloud providers (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, etc.), which makes it very flexible.
	- CloudFormation is limited to AWS. If you’re only using AWS, this is fine, but if you plan to use other cloud platforms, Terraform offers much more flexibility.
- Modularity and Reusability
    - Terraform allows for creating reusable modules that can be shared across multiple projects. Modules in Terraform are more flexible and portable.
    - CloudFormation also supports templates, but they are more rigid and tied specifically to AWS services.
- Learning Curve
    - Terraform has a relatively simple syntax (HCL), making it easier to learn and use for beginners and experienced users alike.
    - CloudFormation templates are written in JSON or YAML, which can become verbose and harder to manage for complex infrastructures.
- Summary
    - If you need to manage infrastructure across both AWS and Azure, Terraform is a clear choice since it works with both cloud providers. CloudFormation would lock you into AWS only.

### Terraform vs Puppet
- Use Case
    - Terraform is designed to create and manage infrastructure. You would use Terraform to build new cloud resources like servers, networks, and storage.
    - Puppet is used more for configuring existing infrastructure. It’s excellent for ensuring that your systems are always configured correctly (e.g., ensuring certain software is installed on your servers).
- Declarative Nature
    - Both Terraform and Puppet are declarative. This means you specify the desired state of the system, and the tool ensures that the infrastructure or configuration reaches that state.
- Configuration Language:
  - Terraform uses HCL.
  - Puppet uses its own declarative language known as Puppet DSL, which can be harder to grasp for new users.
- Summary
    - If you’re setting up infrastructure for a new cloud-based application, you’d likely use Terraform to provision the cloud resources. Once the resources are up and running, you could use Puppet to make sure the application and security configurations stay consistent across all servers.
