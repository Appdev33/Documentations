## File Structure
- `.tf` files
    - `.tf` files are the main configuration files used in Terraform.
    - They contain the actual infrastructure code written in HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language)
    - Each .tf file defines the resources, providers, variables, and other configuration needed for Terraform to work.
    - Example
        ```hcl
        resource "aws_instance" "my_instance" {
            ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
            instance_type = "t2.micro"
        }
        ```
- `.tfvars` files
    - `.tfvars` files are used to pass variable values into your configuration, allowing you to keep variable definitions separate from resource configurations.
    - This is particularly useful when working with different environments like development and production.
    - Example
        ```hcl
        instance_type = "t2.micro"
        ami = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
        ```
- Best practices for file structure
    - Keep your configurations modular by breaking them into smaller `.tf` files based on function.
        - `main.tf`: Contains primary resource definitions.
        - `variables.tf`: Contains input variable definitions.
        - `outputs.tf`: Contains output definitions.
        - `provider.tf`: Defines the provider block (e.g., AWS, GCP).
        - `terraform.tfvars`: Contains variable values specific to your environment (e.g., dev, prod).

    - Use a separate state file for each environment (e.g., dev, staging, production) to avoid conflicts.
    - Store sensitive information like access keys or passwords in environment-specific `.tfvars` files and exclude these files from version control using `.gitignore`.

## Resources
- Defining resources in Terraform
    - Resources in Terraform are the most important objects, representing infrastructure components such as virtual machines, databases, or networks.
    - You define them using resource blocks in .tf files.
    - Example
        ```hcl
        resource "aws_instance" "example" {
            ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
            instance_type = "t2.micro"
        }
        ```
- Resource blocks and attributes
    - A **resource block** is a set of **attributes** that define the configuration for that resource.
    - Example
        ```hcl
        resource "provider_resource" "name" {
            attribute1 = value1
            attribute2 = value2
        }
        ```
        - **Provider resource** refers to the cloud service or platform you're using (e.g., aws_instance for AWS EC2).
        - **Attributes** define the specific characteristics of that resource (e.g., ami, instance_type).
- Resource dependencies
    - Terraform automatically manages resource dependencies.
    - However, you can manually set dependencies using the `depends_on` meta-argument to force one resource to be created before another.
    - Example
        ```hcl
        resource "aws_instance" "my_instance" {
            depends_on    = [aws_security_group.my_sg]
            ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
            instance_type = "t2.micro"
        }
        ```

## Outputs
- Defining output values
    - Outputs allow you to extract information from your resources and display them once Terraform has completed applying the configuration.
    - Example
        ```hcl
        output "instance_public_ip" {
            value = aws_instance.example.public_ip
        }
        ```
- Referencing outputs in other modules
    - You can reference outputs from one module in another, enabling you to pass information between different parts of your infrastructure.
    - Example: Module `web_server` (in `modules/web_server/main.tf`)
        ```hcl
        resource "aws_instance" "web" {
            ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
            instance_type = "t2.micro"
        }

        output "public_ip" {
            value = aws_instance.web.public_ip
        }
        ```
    - Example: Main Configuration Using the Module
        ```hcl
        module "web_server" {
           source = "./modules/web_server"
        }

        output "web_server_ip" {
            value = module.web_server.public_ip
        }
        ```
- Sharing output between configurations
    - Outputs can be shared between Terraform configurations using remote state files.
    - This helps when you have separate Terraform projects that need to communicate.

## Providers
- What are providers?
    - Providers are plugins that enable Terraform to interact with APIs of different platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, etc.
    - Each provider is responsible for managing the lifecycle of resources on that platform.
- Provider blocks and configuration
    - You declare a provider in your Terraform configuration to define which platform youâ€™re interacting with.
    - Example
        ```hcl
        provider "aws" {
           region = "us-west-2"
        }
        ```
- Managing provider versions
    - It's best practice to specify the version of the provider to ensure consistency across deployments.
    - Example
        ```hcl
        provider "aws" {
            version = "~> 3.0"
            region  = "us-west-2"
        }
        ```

## Data Sources
- What are data sources?
    - Data sources allow Terraform to query existing resources managed outside of its scope. 
    - For example, you can use a data source to fetch information about an already existing VPC or AMI.
- Using data sources to query existing infrastructure
    - A data source block retrieves information from external systems or other Terraform configurations.
    - Example: Getting Data Source
        ```hcl
        data "aws_ami" "latest_ami" {       # a data source that retrieves the latest available Amazon Machine Image (AMI).
            most_recent = true              # ensures Terraform fetches the most recent AMI that matches the criteria.
            owners      = ["amazon"]        # filters the AMIs to only those owned by Amazon (official images).
            filter {                        # defines additional criteria
                name   = "name"             # filtering AMIs by their name.
                values = ["amzn-ami-hvm-*"] # AMI name should match this wildcard pattern.
            }
        }
        ```
    - Example: Using the Data Source
        ```hcl
        resource "aws_instance" "example" {
            ami           = data.aws_ami.latest_ami.id
            instance_type = "t2.micro"
        }
        ```
- Common use cases for data sources
    - **Querying VPCs**:  use a data source to look up an existing VPC's ID instead of hardcoding it.
        ```hcl
        data "aws_vpc" "main_vpc" {
            filter {
                name   = "tag:Name"
                values = ["main-vpc"]
            }
        }
        ```
    - **Looking Up DNS Information**: Query existing DNS records and use them in your infrastructure.
        ```hcl
        data "aws_route53_zone" "main_zone" {
            name = "example.com."
        }
        ```
    - **Retrieving Information on Existing Subnets**: query an existing subnet's ID and use it in your resources.
        ```hcl
        data "aws_subnet" "main_subnet" {
            filter {
                name   = "tag:Name"
                values = ["main-subnet"]
            }
        }
        ```
    - **Fetching AWS Secrets Manager Secrets**: retrieve secrets stored in AWS Secrets Manager and use them in your configurations.
        ```hcl
        data "aws_secretsmanager_secret" "db_password" {
            name = "prod/db-password"
        }

        data "aws_secretsmanager_secret_version" "db_password_version" {
            secret_id = data.aws_secretsmanager_secret.db_password.id
        }

        output "db_password" {
            value = data.aws_secretsmanager_secret_version.db_password_version.secret_string
        }
        ```
    - **Getting S3 Bucket Information**: Query an existing S3 bucket to retrieve details.
        ```hcl
        data "aws_s3_bucket" "example" {
           bucket = "my-example-bucket"
        }
        ```

## Expressions and Operators
- Basic expressions in Terraform
    - Expressions in Terraform allow you to compute or manipulate values.
    - Basic expressions include setting values for variables or resource attributes.
    - Example
        ```hcl
        resource "aws_instance" "example" {
            count = var.create_instance ? 1 : 0
        }
        ```
- Operators
    - **Arithmetic operators**: Used for mathematical operations
    - **Logical operators**: Used for boolean logic (e.g., &&, ||, !).
    - **Conditional operators**: Ternary operators allow you to set conditions.
    - Example:
        ```hcl
        variable "is_production" {
            type    = bool
            default = false
        }

        variable "instance_base_count" {
            type    = number
            default = 2
        }

        output "instance_count" {
            value = var.is_production ? (var.instance_base_count + 3) : (var.instance_base_count - 1)
        }

        output "is_large_environment" {
            value = var.instance_base_count >= 5
        }

        output "security_check" {
            value = var.is_production && var.instance_base_count > 1
        }

        output "default_port" {
            value = var.is_production ? 443 : 80
        }
        ```
- Working with interpolation
    - Interpolation refers to the use of expressions within strings. 
    - You can dynamically reference variables or resource attributes using ${} syntax.
    - Example
        ```hcl
        output "instance_id" {
            value = "${aws_instance.example.id}"
        }
        ```
