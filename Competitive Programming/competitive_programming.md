# Searching
- Linear Search
  - Given an unsorted array and a target element, return the index of the target.
  - Find the first occurrence of an element in a list of repeated integers.
- Binary Search
  - Search for a given target in a sorted array
  - Find the square root of a number using binary search with precision up to 6 decimal places.
  - Find the first occurrence of an element in a sorted array with duplicates.
  - Find the peak element in a mountain array

# Divide and Conquer
- Quick Sort
