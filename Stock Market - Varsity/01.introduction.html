      <h3>Asset Allocation</h3>
      Technique of allocating money across assets. The ration in which one allocates investments across assets is dependents on the risk appetite of the investor.

      <div class="example">
        For instance, a young professional may take a higher amount of risk given his age and years of investment available to him. Typically investors should allocate around 70% of their investable amount in Equity, 20% in Precious metals, and the rest in Fixed income investments.<br/>
        Alongside the same rationale, a retired person could invest 80 per cent of his saving in fixed income, 10 per cent in equity markets and 10 per cent in precious metals. The ratio in which one allocates investments across asset classes depends on the investor's risk appetite.

      <h3>Depository and Depository Participants</h3>
      The share certificate in DEMAT format has to be stored digitally. The storage place for the digital share certificate is the 'DEMAT Account'. A Depository is a financial intermediary which offers the service of the Demat account. A DEMAT account in your name will have all the shares in the electronic format you bought. Think of the DEMAT account as a digital vault for your shares.
      <div class="notes">
        // Before 1996 the share certificate was in paper format; however post 1996, the share certificates were converted to digital form. Converting a paper format share certificate into a digital format share certificate is called "Dematerialization" often abbreviated as DEMAT.
