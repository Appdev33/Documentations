    - Overview of important modules: `math`, `random`, `time`, `os`, `sys`.
    - Practical examples using these modules in competitive programming.
  - Packages
    - Creating and using packages.
    - `__init__.py` file and its significance.
    - Understanding relative imports.

# Introduction
## Modules vs Packages
- **Modules:** These are single files (with a .py extension) that contain Python code. Modules can contain functions, classes, variables, and runnable code.
- **Packages:** A package is a collection of modules organized in directories that include a special `__init__.py` file. Packages allow you to structure your Python project into hierarchical directories, making the project more modular and easier to manage.
