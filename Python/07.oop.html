      <span class="point">Definition</span>
      <ul>
        <li>A <span class="code">Class</span> is a user-defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created. Classes provide a means of bundling data and functionality together.</li>
        <li>Each class instance or <span class="code">Object</span> can have attributes attached to it for maintaining its state. Objects can also have methods (defined by their class) for modifying their state.</li>
        <li>A class is like a blueprint while an instance is a copy of the class with actual values</li>
      </ul>
      <span class="point">Properties</span>
      <ul>
        <li>Classes are created by keyword class.</li>
        <li>Attributes are the variables that belong to a class.</li>
        <li>Attributes are always public and can be accessed using the dot (.) operator.</li>
      </ul>
      <span class="point">An object consists of</span>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="point">State</span>: It is represented by the attributes of an object. It also reflects the properties of an object.</li>
        <li><span class="point">Behavior</span>: It is represented by the methods of an object. It also reflects the response of an object to other objects.</li>
        <li><span class="point">Identity</span>: It gives a unique name to an object and enables one object to interact with other objects.</li>
      </ul>
      <pre><code class="language-python">
    class Dog:
        def __init__(self, name): # constructor
            self.name = name # class attribute
        def fun(self): # class method
            print("My name is", self.name)
    Rodger = Dog("Rogder") # Object instantiation
    print(Rodger.name) # Rogder
    Rodger.fun() # My name is Rogder
      </code></pre>

      <h3>self</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Class methods must have an extra first parameter in the method definition. We do not give a value for this parameter when we call the method, Python provides it.</li>
        <li>If we have a method that takes no arguments, then we still have to have one argument (ie self)</li>
        <li>This is similar to this pointer in C++ and this reference in Java.</li>
      </ul>
      <br/><br/>
      <div class="notes">
        <ul>
          <li>When we call a method of this object as myobject.method(arg1, arg2), this is automatically converted by Python into MyClass.method(myobject, arg1, arg2)</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h3>__init__ ()</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="point">The __init__ method</span> is similar to constructors in C++ and Java. Constructors are used to initializing the object's state.</li>
        <li>It runs as soon as an object of a class is instantiated. The method is useful to do any initialization you want to do with your object.</li>
        <li>Constructor can be <span class="point">Default (no parameters except self)</span> or <span class="point">Parameterized (multiple parameters)</span></li>
      </ul>

      <h3>__del__ ()</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="point">The __del__ method</span> is similar to destructors in C++ and Java. It is called when all references to the object have been deleted i.e when an object is garbage collected.</li>
        <li>In Python, destructors are not needed as much as in C++ because Python has a garbage collector that handles memory management automatically.</li>
      </ul>


      <h3>Class and instance variable</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="point">Instance variables</span> are variables whose value is assigned inside a constructor or method with self whereas <span class="point">class variables</span> are variables whose value is assigned in the class.</li>
      </ul>
      <pre><code class="language-python">
    class Dog:
        animal = "dog"
        def __init__(self, name): # set instance variable through constructor
            self.name = name # class attribute
        def fun(self): # class method
            print("My name is", self.name)
        def changeName(self, name):
            self.name = name # change instance variable through class method
        def __del__(self):
            print("destructing object")
    Rodger = Dog("Rogder") # Object instantiation
    Rodger.fun() # My name is Rodger
    Rodger.changeName("Sam")
    Rodger.fun() # My name is Sam
      </code></pre>
