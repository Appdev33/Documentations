      <div class="topic-body">
        <h3>Status Code 400</h3>
        
        <h4>AccessDeniedException</h4>
        Access denied: The client did not correctly sign the request.

        <h4>ConditionalCheckFailedException</h4>
        The conditional request failed: You specified a condition that evaluated to false

        <h4>IncompleteSignatureException</h4>
        The request signature does not conform to AWS standards: The request signature did not include all of the required components.

        <h4>ItemCollectionSizeLimitExceededException</h4>
        Collection size exceeded: For a table with a local secondary index, a group of items with the same partition key value has exceeded the maximum size limit of 10 GB

        <h4>LimitExceededException</h4>
        Too many operations for a given subscriber: There are too many concurrent control plane operations. The cumulative number of tables and indexes in the CREATING, DELETING, or UPDATING state cannot exceed 50.

        <h4>MissingAuthenticationTokenException</h4>
        Request must contain a valid (registered) AWS Access Key ID: The request did not include the required authorization header, or it was malformed.

        <h4>ProvisionedThroughputExceededException</h4>
        You exceeded your maximum allowed provisioned throughput for a table or for one or more global secondary indexes. To view performance metrics for provisioned throughput vs. consumed throughput, open the Amazon CloudWatch console.

        <h4>RequestLimitExceeded</h4>
        Throughput exceeds the current throughput limit for your account.

        <h4>ResourceInUseException</h4>
        The resource which you are attempting to change is in use.

        <h4>ResourceNotFoundException</h4>
        Requested resource not found.

        <h4>ThrottlingException</h4>
        Rate of requests exceeds the allowed throughput: This exception is returned as an AmazonServiceException response with a THROTTLING_EXCEPTION status code. This exception might be returned if you perform control plane API operations too rapidly.

        <h4>UnrecognizedClientException</h4>
        The Access Key ID or security token is invalid.: The request signature is incorrect. The most likely cause is an invalid AWS access key ID or secret key.

        <h4>ValidationException</h4>
        Varies, depending upon the specific error(s) encountered: This error can occur for several reasons, such as a required parameter that is missing, a value that is out of range, or mismatched data types. The error message contains details about the specific part of the request that caused the error.

        <h3>HTTP Status Code 5xx</h3>
        <p>An HTTP 5xx status code indicates a problem that must be resolved by AWS.</p>

        <h4>Internal Server Error (HTTP 500)</h4>
        DynamoDB could not process your request.

        <h4>Service Unavailable (HTTP 503)</h4>
        DynamoDB is currently unavailable. (This should be a temporary state.)

          <ul>
            <li>The usual technique for dealing with these error responses in a networked environment is to implement retries in the client application. This technique increases the reliability of the application.</li>
            <li>Each AWS SDK implements retry logic automatically. You can modify the retry parameters to your needs.</li>
            <li>If you&#39;re not using an AWS SDK, you should retry original requests that receive server errors (5xx). However, client errors (4xx, other than a ThrottlingException or a ProvisionedThroughputExceededException) indicate that you need to revise the request itself to correct the problem before trying again.</li>
            <li>In addition to simple retries, each AWS SDK implements an exponential backoff algorithm for better flow control.</li>
          </ul>

            // Dynamo DB&#39;s batch operations (<span class="code">BatchGetItem</span> and <span class="code">BatchWriteItem</span>) are implemented as wrappers around other non-batch DynamoDB operations. The batch operations return information about individual requests that fail so that you can diagnose the problem and retry the operation.
