      <h3>Requirement</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>AWS account</li>
        <li>EC2 instance for compute capacity
          <ul>
            <li>choose an AMI (Amazon Machine Image) - is the softwares and application packages that we would need to run the application
              <ul>
                <li>it is a template that is used to create an instance/machine based on user requirement.</li>
                <li>it contains: Software information, OS information, Volume information, Access permissions, etc</li>
                <li>2 types: Predefined (Amazon provided from AMI Marketplace) or Custom</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>choose an instance type - choose h/w depending on the workload, and choose size of the h/w depending on the intensity of the workload.
              <ul>
                <li>specifies hardware specifications that are required in the machine form the previous step.</li>
                <li>categorized into 5 main families: Compute optimized (for high processing power), Memory optimized (for in-memory caching), GPU optimized (large graphical requirement), Storage optimized (storage servers), General purpose</li>
                <li>instance types are fixed and can not be altered.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>configure instance - eg. no of instances, which subnet do we want them in, what's going to be the terminate behaviour of the instances, do we need to update any package when instance starts running, etc
              <ul>
                <li>specify the number of instances, purchasing options, kind of network, subnet, when to assign public IP, IAM role, shutdown behaviour, add bootstrap scripts when VM starts, etc</li>
                <li>multiple payment options are available: on-demand instance, reserved instance, spot instance</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>adding additional storage - to EC2 instance
              <ul>
                <li>deciding type of storage: Ephemeral (temporary and free), Amazon Elastic Block Store (permanant and paid), Amazon S3</li>
              </ul>
            <li>add tags - to easily identify the EC2 instance at a later point.</li>
            <li>configure security group (aka firewall) - to allow/deny connection to/from the outside world.
              <ul>this is where user can finetune the access to the EC2 instance based on port number and IP address</ul>
            </li>
            <li>review and launch
              <ul>
                <li>Before launching, Amazon gives us option to create a key pair (public and private). Private key (.pem file) is downloaded by the user, and kept secret. The public key is kept by Amazon to identify the user.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>

            <li>Add subscribers to the topic.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Create a bucket in S3
          <ul>
            <li>store the content in this bucket.</li>
            <li>Create an event in the bucket relating it with SNS.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li> Sync the S3 bucket and AWS instance.</li>
      </ul>
