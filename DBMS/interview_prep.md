# DBMS Core
## What is the difference between a database and a DBMS?
`DataBase` `DBMS` `DBMS Core`
- A **Database** is a structured collection of data. A **DBMS (Database Management System)** is the software that interacts with the database. It helps in creating, managing, manipulating, and securing the data within the database.
## What are the types of DBMS?
`DBMS` `DBMS Core`

# ACID Properties
## Explain the ACID properties in the context of transaction management.
`DataBase Concept` `ACID Properties` `Atomicity` `Consistency` `Durability` `Isolation`
- **ACID** stands for **Atomicity**, **Consistency**, **Isolation**, and **Durability** - the four key properties that guarantee **reliable** and **safe** transactions in a database system.
- **Atomicity**: Ensures that all parts of a transaction succeed or none do.
- **Consistency**: Ensures that a transaction leaves the DB in a valid state, preserving all constraints and rules.
- **Isolation**: Ensures that a transaction does not affect other transactions.
- **Durability**: Ensures that a transaction is stored permanently in the DB, even if the system crashes.
