## Question
In PostgreSQL, which of the following is true about foreign key constraints?
## Options
- [ ] Deleting a referenced row will always result in an error
- [ ] `ON DELETE CASCADE` deletes referencing rows automatically
- [ ] `ON DELETE SET NULL` sets the referencing column to zero
- [ ] Foreign key constraints can only reference primary keys of other tables
## Answer
2. `ON DELETE CASCADE` deletes referencing rows automatically

```python
"Deleting a referenced row will always result in an error"
‚ùå Not always true. By default, deleting a referenced row without handling the FK would raise an error (ON DELETE RESTRICT behavior), but you can change it with ON DELETE CASCADE, ON DELETE SET NULL, etc.
"ON DELETE CASCADE deletes referencing rows automatically"
‚úÖ Correct. If the parent row is deleted, all referencing (child) rows are automatically deleted.
"ON DELETE SET NULL sets the referencing column to zero"
‚ùå Wrong. It sets the referencing column to NULL, not zero (and only if the column is nullable).
"Foreign key constraints can only reference primary keys of other tables"
‚ùå Not strictly true. They can reference any column (or set of columns) with a unique constraint (primary key OR unique key).
üëâ Correct answer: ON DELETE CASCADE deletes referencing rows automatically ‚úÖ
```

2. `SELECT * FROM users WHERE email LIKE ‚Äò%gmail.com%‚Äô`

```sql

Isolation Levels in MySQL (and SQL standard):
Read Uncommitted
Allows dirty reads ‚ùå (you can see uncommitted changes from other transactions).
Lowest isolation level.
Read Committed
Prevents dirty reads ‚úÖ
But still allows non-repeatable reads (data can change if re-read in the same transaction).
Used by Oracle, SQL Server by default.
Repeatable Read (MySQL default)
Prevents dirty reads ‚úÖ
Prevents non-repeatable reads ‚úÖ
But allows phantom reads (new rows appearing in a repeated query).
Serializable
Strictest level. Prevents dirty, non-repeatable, and phantom reads.
Basically transactions run as if executed one after another.

üëâ Correct answer: Read Committed ‚úÖ

```
