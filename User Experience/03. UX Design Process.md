## Stages of UX Design
### Research
- Understand the users, their needs, behaviors, and the context in which they interact with the product.
- **Activities**
  - **User Research:** Interviews, surveys, observations.
  - **Market Analysis:** Understanding industry trends and competitors.
  - **Defining Requirements:** Gathering business objectives and user needs.
- **Deliverables**
  - User personas
  - User journey maps
  - Requirements documentation
### Design
- Create solutions that address user needs identified during the research phase.
- **Activities**
  - **Information Architecture (IA):** Structuring content logically.
  - **Wireframing:** Sketching layouts and interface elements.
  - **Prototyping:** Building interactive models of the product.
- **Deliverables**
  - Site maps
  - Wireframes
  - Interactive prototypes
### Testing
- Validate design solutions with real users to identify usability issues and areas for improvement.
- **Activities**
  - **Usability Testing:** Observing users as they interact with the product.
  - **A/B Testing:** Comparing two versions to see which performs better.
  - **Accessibility Testing:** Ensuring the product is usable by people with disabilities.
- **Deliverables**
  - Test reports
  - User feedback
  - Recommendations for improvements
### Implementation
- Develop and launch the product, ensuring that the design is accurately translated into the final product.
- **Activities**
  - **Collaboration with Developers:** Communicating design specifications.
  - **Design Handoff:** Providing assets and guidelines.
  - **Quality Assurance (QA):** Testing the product for bugs and inconsistencies.
- **Deliverables**
  - Final product
  - Style guides
  - Design system documentation

## Agile and Lean UX
### Agile UX
- integrates UX practices into Agile software development frameworks.
- focuses on iterative development, where requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration between cross-functional teams.
- **Principles**
  - **Iterative Design:** Continuous refinement based on feedback.
  - **Collaboration:** Close cooperation between designers, developers, and stakeholders.
  - **Time-Boxed Sprints:** Work is divided into short, manageable periods (usually 1-2 weeks).
- **Benefits**
  - Faster delivery of usable products.
  - Improved communication and alignment among team members.
  - Ability to respond quickly to changes in requirements.
### Lean UX
- inspired by Lean Startup principles.
- emphasizes eliminating waste, focusing on core functionalities, and validating assumptions quickly.
- **Principles**
  - **Minimum Viable Product (MVP):** Developing the simplest version of a product to test hypotheses.
  - **Cross-Functional Teams:** Diverse skill sets working together.
  - **Continuous Learning:** Rapid experimentation and feedback loops.
- **Benefits**
  - Reduces time and resources spent on unvalidated ideas.
  - Encourages a culture of experimentation and learning.
  - Aligns product development closely with user needs.
### Difference between Agile and Lean UX
- **Focus:** 
  - Agile UX is about integrating UX into Agile development.
  - Lean UX focuses on rapid hypothesis validation and learning.
- **Approach:** 
  - Agile UX follows structured sprints
  - Lean UX is more fluid and centers on outcomes over deliverables.
