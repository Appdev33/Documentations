## Cognitive Psychology Basics
- **Cognitive psychology** studies how people think, learn, and remember.
- In UX design, understanding cognitive processes allows us to create interfaces that align with how users naturally process information.

## Memory
### Sensory Memory
- Briefly retains sensory information.
- Lasts less than a second.
- Design Implication: Use strong visual cues to grab attention quickly.
### Short-Term Memory (Working Memory)
- Holds information temporarily for processing.
- Limited capacity (7±2 items, according to Miller’s Law).
- Design Implication: Avoid overloading users with too much information at once. Simplify tasks.
### Long-Term Memory
- Stores information indefinitely.
- Includes procedural (how-to) and declarative (facts) memory.
- Design Implication: Use familiar icons and patterns to leverage existing knowledge.

## Attention
### Selective Attention:
- Users focus on specific elements while ignoring others.
- Influenced by factors like relevance, contrast, and novelty.
- Design Implication: Highlight important elements using visual hierarchy and contrast.
### Divided Attention
- Multitasking or handling multiple stimuli simultaneously.
- Design Implication: Minimize distractions and guide users through tasks step-by-step.

## Perception
### Gestalt Principles:
- Our brains interpret visual elements as part of a larger whole.
- Design Implication: Arrange elements to reflect natural perception patterns.
### Visual Perception
- Users interpret visual cues like size, color, and motion.
- Design Implication: Use visual cues consistently to convey meaning.
### Pattern Recognition:
- Users recognize patterns and predict outcomes.
- Design Implication: Maintain consistency in design patterns to meet user expectations.

## Gestalt Principles
- explores how people perceive visual components as organized patterns or wholes, rather than just a collection of separate elements.

### Principle of Proximity
- Elements that are close to each other are perceived as related.
- Design Application:
  - Group related items together (e.g., navigation menus).
  - Use spacing to separate unrelated elements.
- Example: 
  - In a form, grouping labels and input fields together helps users understand they are related.

### Principle of Similarity
- Elements that are similar in appearance are perceived as part of the same group.
- Design Application:
  - Use consistent styles for similar functions (e.g., buttons, links).
  - Differentiate elements with distinct functions.
- Example:
  - All clickable buttons share the same color and shape, indicating their interactivity.

### Principle of Continuity
- The eye is drawn along paths, lines, and curves, perceiving a continuous flow.
- Design Application:
  - Align elements to guide the user’s eye.
  - Use directional cues like arrows or lines.
- Example:
  - A breadcrumb trail uses linear progression to show navigation hierarchy.

### Principle of Closure
- The mind fills in missing information to perceive a complete image.
- Design Application:
  - Use incomplete shapes or patterns to create interest.
  - Allow users to infer information without overloading them.
- Example:
  - A dotted outline of a shape suggests a complete form without drawing every line.

### Principle of Figure-Ground
- Elements are perceived as either the focus (figure) or the background (ground).
- Design Application:
  - Ensure important content stands out against the background.
  - Use contrast to distinguish interactive elements.
- Example:
  - A modal window appears prominently over a dimmed background.

### Principle of Common Fate
- Elements moving in the same direction are perceived as related.
- Design Application:
  - Use animations to group elements functionally.
  - Indicate relationships through synchronized movements.
- Example
  - In a carousel, images slide together in the same direction, indicating they are part of a set.
